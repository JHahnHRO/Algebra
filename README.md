# Some light maths-themed programming exercises

Contains some simple code for mathematical concepts and algorithms,
e.g. [Interval](src/main/java/org/example/math/Interval.java) for set operations with intervals
and [Graph](src/main/java/org/example/math/graph/Graph.java) for graph-traversal.

Eventually, I hope to find the motivation to code enough algebra to check a conjecture from my dissertation in a few
more cases. But that requires coding stuff for non-commutative Groebner basis and that's a long way away.
